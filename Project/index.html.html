            <p>The Pfister Hotel opened its doors in 1893, costing over $1 million to build. The hotel was an advancement of the times as it provided fireproofing, thermostat control, and electricity! It was known to be a “Grand Hotel of the West”. The Pfister Hotel still operates even to this day as one of the historical sites of downtown Milwaukee.
<br><br>
            Due to the long history of the hotel, many stories and rumors have made themselves known to the hotel’s reputation. Many Major league baseball players have found themselves unsettled by the unexplainable happenings within the hotel's walls, from electrical anomalies, objects moving on their own, and even apparitions. 
<br><br>
            Andre Beltre, a player for the L.S. Dodgers, has even reported hearing strange knocks, the air conditioning and tv turning themselves on, and even being so startled by loud pounding on his hotel door that he slept with a bat for his own protection. He claimed he only got about 2 hours of sleep when within the hotel due to the unsettling experiences.
<br><br>
            Another baseball player, Carlos Gomez of the Minnesota Twins, claims to have heard disembodied voices when staying at the hotel. He even says to have witnessed the iPod he brought with him turn on by itself and vibrate so wildly that it fell to the floor.
<br><br>
            Some people have even reported seeing the apparition of an elderly gentleman roaming the halls of the hotel. Many believe this apparition to be the hotel’s founder, Charles Pfister.

          <summary>Summary</summary>
          <P>The abandoned Witherell House, built in 1853, is known to have a reputation as a place “cursed with death”. 
<br><br>
            The Witherell House was built by former sheriff of Onondaga County, New York, Elihu Phillips. Phillips was the seventh son of his family and spent much of his childhood “breathing on sick kids” because it was believed the seventh son was bestowed with divine healing abilities.
<br><br>
            This blessing, however, did not follow Phillips into adulthood when he lost two wives and all three of his children.
<br><br>            
            Phillips later moved to Wisconsin with his daughter, Ellen, with the belief that it would be better for her. However, Ellen would die and leave Phillips in the house alone two years later.
<br><br>
            Phillips would later sell the house and become founder of the Fond du Lac Savings Bank.
<br><br>
            During the Great Depression, Archie and Adelaide Witherell would come to buy and fix up the house. It seems that they were the last to live in the house proper.
<br><br>
            There is a legend that a man had murdered his wife and daughter in the house before hanging himself in the barn, however it is unknown if this is truly a fact or a simple urban legend that has sprung up in the Witherell House’s long history.
<br><br>
            Many claim to hear screams echo from the house and terrifying shadows passing by the windows.

          <summary>Summary</summary>
          <P>Dartford Cemetery, located in the beautiful Green Lake, is one of Wisconsin's most haunted locations.
<br><br>
            This cemetery is the final resting place for many, from the pioneers to children who had succumbed to diseases. 
<br><br>
            For many years, before European settlers had come around, the Winnebago people, also called the Ho-Chunk, used to consider the idyllic Green Lake a mystic and spiritual place. The Winnebago had called Green Lake “Daycholah” and was a place where they would pay homage to the “spirit that dwells beneath the water”.
<br><br>
            There are many graves within the cemetery, with some being more famous than others. Once such grave is that of Chief Highknocker, the last Winnebago chief to rule over the area, who was said to have died in a tragic swimming accident. Some who visit the cemetery claim to have encountered the ghostly apparition of the late Winnebago chief.
<br><br>
            Another popular spot within Dartford Cemetery is the unusually shaped Jackson Walker mausoleum, where many have claimed to have been pushed off of the mausoleum when they sat upon it.
<br><br>
            The stories that have come out of the Dartford Cemetery range from seeing Native American chief in full traditional dress, to mysterious scratches, epitaphs changing inexplicably, and even encounters with ghost children.

          <summary>Summary</summary>
          <p>Maribel Caves Hotel, also known as Hotel Hell, was built in the 1900’s as a resort and therapeutic spa. It would later become a tavern and remained open until the building caught blaze in 1985. The old building is steeped with dark history, rumors, and legends.
<br><br>
            Many of the stories of the building range from how it supposedly burned down three times, each on the exact same date. Each person in the building at the time of the fires had died in their sleep.
<br><br>            
            It is told that skeletal remains could still be found within the ruins of the building before it was gutted out.
<br><br>            
            It was supposedly owned and served as a hideout of Al Capone during Prohibition.
<br><br>            
            It is said that ghostly figures can be seen on the second floor of the building and ghostly encounters have been reported in the nearby Maribel Caves.
<br><br>            
            The building was gutted out in 2006 and most of the structure had been knocked down by a terrible storm in 2013.

          </figure><details>
            <summary>Summary</summary>
            <p>Originally, the facility of Sheboygan Asylum was opened in Winooski in 1876 to house the chronically insane that were being housed in the jail and hospital. However, in 1978, four of 21 inmates died in a fire that also destroyed the building.
<br><br>
              In 1882, Sheboygan County Comprehensive Health Care Center, or simply Sheboygan Asylum, was built as a replacement to the Winooski facility and served as a care facility for the elderly, mentally ill, and developmentally disabled. In 1944-1945, the building was requisitioned by the US Military and renamed Camp Sheboyga. It was used to house Italian and German WWII prisoners who would be put to work in the fields.
<br><br>              
              In 1969, the building was once again used to house the mentally ill. In 1978, it began housing the chronically ill and those with developmental disabilities. The facility started losing business in the 1980 before closing its doors entirely in 2002.
<br><br>             
              Many former employees of the Asylum had said they experienced many paranormal occurrences during the final years of working there. With these rumors floating around, it brought about many curious tourists, paranormal investigators, and explorers to be arrested for trespassing into the building.
<br><br>              
              Visitors to the abandoned Sheboygan Asylum have claimed to hear a young girl humming, being touched by unseen entities, hair being pulled by unknown forces, screams echoing down the halls, loud bangs coming from deep within the building, and disembodied whispers being heard.
<br><br>              
              With the numerous amounts of nurses said to have committed suicide in the building, it goes as no surprise that such ghostly rumors have circulated around the abandoned building.
<br><br>              
              The Sheboygan Asylum is private property and no trespassing is allowed. Ghost tours are conducted by Fox Valley Ghost Hunters to allow one to experience the Asylum without the need of trespassing.
